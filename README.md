# Electronic Store

The store sells 7 products: game consoles, headphones, laptops, phones, smart watches, tablets and TVs.

When starting the program you have three options:
(1) Log in as a user.
(2) Log in as an admin.
(0) Close the program.

When the first option is selected, the program asks you which category you want to see. 
After selecting a category, the program asks you if you want to see it unsorted or sorted by price.
Then you have two options. The first is to buy an item. The second is to continue the review.
If you decide to purchase an item, the program will ask you to enter its ID number.
If the ID number is entered correctly, the item will be successfully added to the basket.
You will then be able to see what is in the basket and what is the total price of all the products inside.

If you choose to log in as an administrator, you can add new items to the store, 
but you will first need to enter a password.
